## Introduction 

This data analysis was performed as part of the DSCI 522, Data Workflow course at the University of British Columbia’s Master of Data Science Program. Our team chose to analyze the coffee quality data set to identify the strongest predictor of coffee quality. We will be using an exploratory data analysis roadmap and predictive modeling to create this project.

## Dataset

We will be analyzing the *[Coffee Quality Dataset](https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database)*, collected by the Coffee Quality Institute in January 2018. The data was retrieved from tidytuesday, courtesy of James LeDoux, a Data Scientist at Buzzfeed.The data is collected on Arabica coffee beans from across the world and professionally rated on a 0-100 scale based on factors like acidity, sweetness, fragrance, balance, etc. The dataset also contains information about coffee bean origin country, harvesting and grading date, colour, defects, processing and packaging details.

## Research Question

The research question that we will be attempting to answer in this analysis is: **What is the strongest predictor of arabica coffee quality globally?**
Our primary goal is to find a single feature that most strongly predicts the quality of arabica coffee globally, limited to the given categories provided in the coffee survey. We will begin our analysis by exploring the natural inferential sub-question of which features correlate strongly and positively with coffee quality, and determine if there is any evidence of multicollinearity among the features themselves. Based on our results of this preliminary EDA, we will assess a rank of the features. This will be compared to the resulting coefficients of the features, post analysis.
