    "This project uses the *[Coffee Quality Dataset](https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database)*, collected by the Coffee Quality Institute in January 2018. The data was retrieved from tidytuesday, courtesy of James LeDoux, a Data Scientist at Buzzfeed.The data is collected on Arabica coffee beans from across the world and professionally rated on a 0-100 scale based on factors like acidity, sweetness, fragrance, balance, etc. The dataset also contains information about coffee bean origin country, harvesting and grading date, colour, defects, processing and packaging details. There are 1311 observations in the dataset and 43 features (18 numeric features and 25 categorical features). There are some missing values for certain features which will be preprocessed appropriately if included in the analysis model. There are no missing values in the target column, `total_cup_points`. According to the dataset decription our target, `total_cup_points` is a point scale from 0-100 with mean scale rating of 82.1 points, minimum of 0.0 and maximum of 90.6 points.\n",

    "We wanted to determine which features might be the most important to include to predict coffee quality rating. For preliminary EDA, we looked at some categorical features and only selected those that may be intuitive in adding to the model such as `country_of_origin` and `color` of the coffee beans. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our first exploratory question, we looked at how total ratings differ between the different colours of coffee beans. As shown in Figure 1, the average coffee quality rating did not differ vastly by the colour of the coffee beans. Green color coffee beans were slightly lower in coffee quality rating than blue-green or bluish-green groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Figure 2, we looked at coffee quality ratings differed by country of origin of the beans. The average coffee rating differed between the various countries of origin. The highest average rating of coffee beans were from Ethiopia and the lowest average coffee rating were from Haiti. We will could also explore relationship between other categorical features and the total coffee quality rating with some preprocessing and cleaning of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then explored the relationship between some numerical features in the data set and the target coffee rating to see the correlation between these features. As seen in Figure 3. aroma, flavour, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, uniformity, or sweetness have strong relationship and joint performance. However, upon clarification on these variables, we understand that the total cup points is the sum of these points in the data set.Therefore, including these features might lead to a false interpretation. From looking at these relationships, we can clearly see (and we may have already predicted from our own experience) that organic avocados are likely more expensive than non-organic avocados (figure 1)."
